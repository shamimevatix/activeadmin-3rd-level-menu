# activeadmin-3rd-level-menu

I know a lot of activeadmin users have struggled a lot for showing 3rd level menu at activeadmin without hardcoding at initializer. Here you can do this dynamically without writing much. It is not the best and optimized way. But it gets the job done. Just an extra initializer and you are done.

--p.s.
